# Rebellious Student: A Complementary Learning Framework for Background Feature Enhancement in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This repository provides the official implementation for the training pipeline and the final fusion-based anomaly detection framework introduced in our paper:

**"Rebellious Student: A Complementary Learning Framework for Background Feature Enhancement in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection"**

Our method introduces a complementary learning paradigm that enhances background spectral and spatial representations through a novel rebellious student mechanism. The framework is composed of two sequential training stages, as illustrated below.

Stage 1 — Spectral Enhancement via Reverse Distillation

We employ a reverse-distillation-based pruning strategy to obtain a compact network that focuses on enhancing background spectral features.

Stage 2 — Training the Spatial–Spectral Rebellious Student

Using the spectral enhancement network (FEN) as a teacher, we train a spatial–spectral network that intentionally learns features complementary to the teacher, rather than imitating it.

## HAD100 Dataset
HAD100: https://zhaoxuli123.github.io/HAD100/

## Obtaining Detection Results on HAD100
To obtain anomaly detection results on the HAD100 dataset, execute the following commands. You can specify the number of spectral bands to use with the --input_channel argument:

- For first 50 bands test:
```bash
python test.py --input_channel 50
```
- For first 100 bands test:
```bash
python test.py --input_channel 100
```
- For first 200 bands test:
```bash
python test.py --input_channel 200
```

## Training on HAD100
To train your own model on the HAD100 dataset, run the following command:

step 1:
```bash
cd train_FERD
python train.py
```

step 2:
```bash
python train.py
```
## Anomaly Detection Results on HAD100
The following table presents the mean AUC (mAUC) results achieved using different numbers of spectral bands:

| Bands | mAUC |
| :--: | :--: |
| The First 50 Bands | 0.9953 |
| The First 100 Bands | 0.9910 |
| The First 200 Bands | 0.9902 |


## Obtaining Detection Results on ABU
The corresponding code is located in the `FERS_ABU` directory.

Using the RX detector:
```bash
python test.py
```

Using the AE detector:
```bash
python test.py --detect AE
```
